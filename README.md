## How this game works:

Refresh the game first.
The Game is design such that the user has to pick same dice number and roll the dice again. Each time the user roll dice, the number of dices will decrement by 1 and if the user hold all same dice before reaching zero number of dices to roll, the User Wins and vice versa.
